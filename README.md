# Compound Interest Calculator - Python

## Description
This Python program calculates the compound interest on an investment. The user is prompted to input the principal amount, interest rate, and the time in years. The program validates the input to ensure that none of the values are negative, then computes and displays the final balance after applying the compound interest.

## Features
- Validates user input to ensure that the principal amount, interest rate, and time are non-negative.
- Calculates the compound interest using the formula:

  \[
  A = P * (1 + r/100)^t
  \]

  Where:
  - **A** is the final amount (balance),
  - **P** is the principal,
  - **r** is the interest rate,
  - **t** is the time (in years).

- Displays the final balance rounded to two decimal places for clarity.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `compound_interest_calculator.py` file in a Python environment.
3. Follow the prompts:
   - Enter a valid principal amount (non-negative).
   - Enter a valid interest rate (non-negative).
   - Enter the time in years (non-negative).
4. The program will display the final balance after applying the compound interest.
